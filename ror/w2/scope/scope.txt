Scope in Ruby
https://github.com/jhu-ep-coursera/fullstack-course1-module2/tree/master/Lecture13-Scope

Ruby's rules on scope is what you would expect in a well defined language. There are
some oddities, like mutable Constants in certain situations. Values can be double 
declared and you can find a way to treat certain duplicate variables as local. These
show you what's possible in terms of scopes, but with good coding practices, it 
shouldn't be a point you'd think about for more than a second.
